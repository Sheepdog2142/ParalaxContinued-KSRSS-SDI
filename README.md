**Parallax Continued Support for KSRSS and KSRSS Homeworld**

This repository provides customized support configurations to allow Parallax Continued and KSRSS (including KSRSS Homeworld) to work seamlessly together. This mod does not pull any assets from either KSRSS or Parallax Continued and requires both mods to be installed separately.

The custom configs in this mod a complete refactor of the code to allow KSRSS and KSRSS homeworld to be compatible with the new Paralx Continues. The code had to be redone from scratcs as the KSRSS paralax configs syntax was to outdated with the large changes in Paralax contiued.
