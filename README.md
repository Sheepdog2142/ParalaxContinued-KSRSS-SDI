# **Parallax Continued Support for KSRSS and KSRSS Homeworld**

This repository provides **customized support configurations** to allow **Parallax Continued** and **KSRSS** (including **KSRSS Homeworld**) to work seamlessly together. This mod does **not** pull any assets from either KSRSS or Parallax Continued and requires both mods to be installed separately.

The custom configs in this mod are a **complete refactor** to ensure compatibility between KSRSS and the latest version of Parallax Continued. Due to significant changes in Parallax's codebase, the original KSRSS Parallax configs were outdated, and the code had to be rebuilt from scratch.
